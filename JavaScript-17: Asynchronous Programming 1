Q1. Async JS 1: Declaring async function

Question: Which keyword is used to declare an asynchronous function in JavaScript?

Options:

sync
async
await
promise
Explanation:

sync: This is not a keyword used for asynchronous operations. It suggests synchronous behavior.
async: This is the correct keyword used to declare an asynchronous function in JavaScript. Functions declared with the async keyword return a promise implicitly.
await: This keyword is used inside an async function to pause execution until a promise is resolved.
promise: This is a JavaScript object used for asynchronous operations, but it's not a keyword used to declare an asynchronous function.
So, the correct answer is async.

Q3. Async JS 1: Catching errors

Question: Which method is used to catch errors in an asynchronous function?

Options:

try-catch statement
catch() method
then() method
finally() method
Explanation:

try-catch statement: This is a control flow statement for handling exceptions. It's used to catch errors in synchronous code. However, it doesn't directly handle asynchronous errors.
catch() method: This method is used to handle errors in promises. It's used in conjunction with the then() method to handle both successful and failed promises.
then() method: This method is used to handle the resolved value of a promise. While it can handle errors using the second argument of then(), it's not specifically for catching errors.
finally() method: This method is used to execute code after a promise is settled (either resolved or rejected), regardless of its outcome. It's not primarily used for catching errors.
So, the correct answer is catch() method.

Question: What does the "Promise.all()" method do?

Options:

Executes multiple promises in parallel and returns a new promise that resolves when all promises are resolved.
Executes multiple promises in parallel and returns a new promise that resolves when any promise is resolved.
Executes multiple promises in sequence and returns a new promise that resolves when all promises are resolved.
Executes multiple promises in sequence and returns a new promise that resolves when any promise is resolved.
Explanation:

Option 1: This is the correct description of Promise.all(). It executes multiple promises in parallel and returns a new promise that resolves when all promises are resolved.
Option 2: This is incorrect. Promise.all() waits for all promises to resolve, not just any one of them.
Option 3: This describes a different behavior. Promise.all() executes promises concurrently, not sequentially.
Option 4: This is also incorrect. Promise.all() waits for all promises to resolve, not just any one of them.
So, the correct answer is Executes multiple promises in parallel and returns a new promise that resolves when all promises are resolved.

Options:

To make asynchronous code synchronous.
To make synchronous code asynchronous.
To handle errors in asynchronous code.
To handle errors in synchronous code.
Explanation:

Option 1: Incorrect. The purpose of async/await is not to make asynchronous code synchronous, but rather to make it easier to write and understand asynchronous code in a synchronous style.
Option 2: Correct. The purpose of async/await is to make synchronous code asynchronous, allowing it to wait for asynchronous operations to complete without blocking.
Option 3: Incorrect. While async/await can be used to handle errors in asynchronous code, it's not its primary purpose.
Option 4: Incorrect. async/await is primarily used for asynchronous code, not synchronous code.
So, the correct answer is To make synchronous code asynchronous.

to make asynchronous synchronous Explanation: The “async/await” syntax in JavaScript is used to make asynchronous code appear and behave more like synchronous code. It allows developers to write asynchronous code in a more sequential and readable manner.
ChatGPT
That's a great clarification!

Explanation: The “async/await” syntax in JavaScript is used to make asynchronous code appear and behave more like synchronous code. It allows developers to write asynchronous code in a more sequential and readable manner. With async/await, asynchronous operations can be written in a way that looks like traditional synchronous code, making it easier to understand and maintain. By using the async keyword, functions return promises implicitly, and the await keyword allows the code to pause and wait for promises to resolve, effectively making asynchronous code flow in a more synchronous manner.

Q3. Async JS 1: Advantage of promises

Question: What is the advantage of using promises in asynchronous JavaScript code?

Options:

Promises simplify error handling in asynchronous code.
Promises automatically handle memory management in asynchronous code.
Promises improve performance in asynchronous code.
Promises eliminate the need for callbacks in asynchronous code.
Explanation:

Option 1: Correct. Promises simplify error handling in asynchronous code by allowing you to chain .then() and .catch() methods to handle success and error cases separately, making error handling more straightforward compared to traditional callback-based approaches.
Option 2: Incorrect. Promises do not automatically handle memory management. Memory management in JavaScript is handled by the JavaScript engine itself and is not directly related to promises.
Option 3: Incorrect. Promises themselves do not necessarily improve performance in asynchronous code. However, they can improve code readability and maintainability.
Option 4: Incorrect. Promises do not eliminate the need for callbacks entirely, but they provide a more structured and readable way to handle asynchronous operations compared to callbacks.
So, the correct answer is Promises simplify error handling in asynchronous code.

Options:

It makes the function run asynchronously.
It automatically converts the function into a promise.
It ensures the function is executed before other asynchronous code.
It enables the use of the "await" keyword inside the function.
Explanation:

Option 1: Incorrect. The async keyword does not make the function run asynchronously by itself. It enables asynchronous behavior by allowing the use of the await keyword inside the function.
Option 2: Correct. When the async keyword is used before a function definition, it automatically converts the function into a promise. The function will always return a promise, either resolved with the return value of the function or rejected with an exception thrown from within the function.
Option 3: Incorrect. The async keyword doesn't ensure the function is executed before other asynchronous code. It only affects the behavior of the function itself.
Option 4: Incorrect. While using async does enable the use of the await keyword inside the function, it doesn't specifically enable this feature. It's more about the function returning a promise.
So, the correct answer is It automatically converts the function into a promise.

Question: What happens if a promise is rejected and no "catch()" method is called on it?

Options:

The program crashes.
The promise remains in a pending state.
The error is silently ignored.
An unhandled promise rejection error is thrown.
Explanation:

Option 1: Incorrect. JavaScript won't crash due to an unhandled promise rejection.
Option 2: Incorrect. If a promise is rejected and no catch() method is called, the promise will still be in a settled state (rejected), not pending.
Option 3: Incorrect. In most cases, errors should not be silently ignored, especially in asynchronous code.
Option 4: Correct. If a promise is rejected and no catch() method is called, an unhandled promise rejection error is thrown. This is to alert developers about unhandled errors in their code.
So, the correct answer is An unhandled promise rejection error is thrown.
